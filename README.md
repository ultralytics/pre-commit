# üõ† Ultralytics Pre-commit Hooks

This repository contains pre-commit hooks developed by [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) for ensuring code quality and standards in our software development practices. By leveraging these hooks, developers can automate the process of code validation, thus maintaining a high level of code hygiene.

## üóÇ Repository Structure

The repository is thoughtfully structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding:

- A `hooks` directory comprising all the individual Python scripts, each serving as a distinct hook for specific checks or code quality assurances.
- The `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file located at the root, which specifies the available hooks for easy integration into your projects.

### Hook Scripts in `hooks` Directory üìÇ

Each script housed within the `hooks` directory is a self-contained Python program designed to carry out a particular pre-commit check. For example:

- `capitalize_comments.py`: This script ensures that the first letter of standalone inline comments begins with a capital letter, fostering readability and a professional codebase demeanor.

### Defining Hooks in `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` üìò

Hooks available for installation are declared within the `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file. An example definition would resemble:

```yaml
- id: hook-id
  name: 'A Name Describing What the Hook Does'
  entry: hooks/name_of_your_hook_script.py
  language: python
  types: [python]
```

Where the elements are as follows:
+ `hook-id` represents a unique identifier for the hook you are configuring.
+ `A Name Describing What the Hook Does`: A brief, intuitive name that indicates the functionality of the hook.
+ `name_of_your_hook_script.py` is the filename for the Python script that resides in the `hooks` directory and codifies the logic for the hook.

## ‚ûï Adding Additional Hooks

If you're interested in contributing a fresh hook, here's how you can add one:

1. **Craft Your Hook Script**: Write a Python script that encapsulates the functionality of your new hook. This script should be placed within the `hooks` directory. For maintainability and ease-of-understanding, ensure your script contains appropriate error handling and outputs useful messages.
2. **Declare Your New Hook**: Extend the `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` with a new block that follows the definition pattern showcased earlier.
3. **Local Testing**: Before integrating your hook into the repository, ensure that you have tested it in a local project setting to affirm its operational behavior.
4. **Sync to Repository**: After satisfactory local validation, commit your work to the repository and initiate a push to share your hook with the community.

## üîß Installing Hooks in Your Project

To harness the power of Ultralytics pre-commit hooks within your project, add their specifications into your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` like so:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/ultralytics/pre-commit-hooks
  rev: main  # You might prefer pinning this to a specific git tag or commit SHA.
  hooks:
    - id: hook-id
```

Execute this command within your project's directory to set up the pre-commit framework:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
With this action, the identified pre-commit hooks from Ultralytics will now be a part of your workflow, automatically running during the commit phase.
