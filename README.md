# üõ†Ô∏è Ultralytics Pre-commit Hooks

Welcome to the Ultralytics pre-commit hooks repository! This collection features hooks developed by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) to enforce code quality and maintain consistent standards across our software projects. Integrating these hooks into your development workflow automates code validation, ensuring a high level of code hygiene and reducing manual review efforts. Learn more about the [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) itself on their official website.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

This repository is organized for clarity and ease of use:

-   **`hooks/` directory:** Contains individual [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts, each representing a distinct pre-commit hook designed for specific checks or code formatting tasks.
-   **`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`:** The root configuration file defining the available hooks, making them discoverable and easy to integrate into your projects.

### Hook Scripts in `hooks` Directory üìÇ

Each script within the `hooks` directory is a standalone Python program performing a specific pre-commit task. For instance:

-   `capitalize_comments.py`: Ensures that standalone inline comments start with a capital letter, promoting readability and a professional coding style.

### Defining Hooks in `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` üìò

The `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file lists all installable hooks. Here's an example structure for a hook definition:

```yaml
- id: hook-id # Unique identifier for the hook
  name: "A descriptive name for the hook" # User-friendly name
  entry: hooks/your_hook_script.py # Path to the hook script
  language: python # Specifies the language the script is written in
  types: [python] # File types the hook should run on
```

## ‚ûï Adding New Hooks

Interested in contributing a new hook? Follow these steps:

1.  **Create Your Hook Script:** Develop a Python script implementing your desired check or formatting logic. Place it in the `hooks/` directory. Ensure your script includes clear error messages and handles potential edge cases.
2.  **Declare the Hook:** Add a new entry for your hook in the `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file, following the structure shown above.
3.  **Test Locally:** Thoroughly test your hook in a local project environment using `pre-commit run --all-files` to confirm it works as expected before submitting.
4.  **Submit Your Contribution:** Commit your changes and create a Pull Request to the repository. Adhering to our [contribution guidelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/contributing/) is appreciated.

## üîß Installing Hooks in Your Project

To use Ultralytics pre-commit hooks in your own project, add the following to your project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/ultralytics/pre-commit-hooks
  rev: main # Pin to 'main' for the latest, or a specific git tag/commit SHA for stability
  hooks:
    - id: capitalize-comments # Example: Use the ID of the hook you want to include
    # Add other hook IDs as needed
```

After updating your configuration, run this command in your project's root directory to install the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now, the specified Ultralytics hooks will automatically run on your staged files each time you commit, helping maintain code quality effortlessly as part of your [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/continuous-integration-ci) process.
