# Ultralytics Pre-commit Hooks ü§ñ

Welcome to the official repository housing Ultralytics' pre-commit hooks, tailor-made to promote high coding standards and enable streamlined codebase quality management. 

## ‚ú® About This Repository

Within this repository, you'll find a curated selection of pre-commit hooks, each purpose-built by our team at [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) to ensure a meticulous approach to coding practices.

### Repository Blueprint

The blueprint of the repository encompasses:

- A `hooks` directory featuring the individual Python scripts embodying the hooks.
- A `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` located at the root level, which outlines the hooks accessible for installation.

#### Hooks in the `hooks` Directory

Each individual hook is materialized through a Python script residing in the `hooks` directory. For instance, the `capitalize_comments.py` script appoints itself the role of capitalizing the initial letter of standalone inline comments.

#### Manifesting Hooks in `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`

Every installable hook receives its declaration within the `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file. A hook's narrative here looks akin to:

```yaml
- id: hook-id
  name: 'Descriptive Hook Name'
  entry: hooks/hook_script.py
  language: python
  types: [python]
```

Dissected, the keys represent:
- `id`: A distinct identifier for the hook.
- `name`: A brief, yet descriptive, title shedding light on the hook's essence.
- `entry`: The pathway to the script encasing the hook's logic.

## üõ† Adding New Pre-Commit Hooks

To contribute a brand-new hook:
1. **Craft the Hook Script**: Pen down a Python script with the hook's functionality and integrate it within the `hooks` directory, ensuring robust error checks and decipherable output.
2. **Unveil the Hook**: Introduce a fresh stanza in the `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` adhering to the aforementioned schema.
3. **Local Testing**: Validate the hook on a local scale within a project to guarantee its intended conduct.
4. **Commit & Promulgate**: Post-validation, commit these modifications and push them up to this repository.

## üì• How to Install Hooks into Your Project

You can latch these hooks onto your primary project by referencing this remote hook repository in your project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/ultralytics/pre-commit
  rev: main  # Substitutable with a specific git tag/revision
  hooks:
    - id: hook-id
```

To activate the hooks, execute this within your project's sanctuary:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Following this, any commit you contrive will automatically enlist the pre-commit hooks delineated here as part of your version control rituals.
